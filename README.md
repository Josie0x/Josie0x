# Josie Charles 🫆
 SOC Analyst | Threat Detector
  
**I turn logs into stories, alerts into action, and threats into lessons learned 📝.**

## 🐾 Path to the SOC
- **CompTIA CySA+**  
- **Splunk Core Certified User** ✅  
- NDG Linux Essentials  
- Cisco Network Essentials  
🖥️ Leveling up with **TryHackMe,HackTheBox,LetsDefend ** and custom **homelabs**, diving into **Splunk dashboards, SIEM analytics, and Active Directory exploits**.

## 🧭 TryHackMe [Labs](https://github.com/Josie0x/-SOC-Lab-Experience-) & Hands-On Simulation
I use TryHackMe and HacktTheBox to gain practical SOC experience, applying detection, monitoring, and incident response techniques in simulated environments.

- 🔍 **Splunk Alert Triage** → Reviewed and categorized alerts, identified false positives, and escalated incidents appropriately.  
- 🖥️ **Log Analysis** → Analyzed Windows, Linux, and Active Directory logs to detect suspicious activity and anomalies.  
- 📊 **Incident Documentation** → Created clear incident reports and documented findings following standard SOC procedures.  
- ⚡ **SIEM Queries** → Built queries and dashboards in Splunk to monitor events and validate alerts.  
- 🛡️ **Threat Verification** → Investigated indicators of compromise (IoCs) and correlated events across multiple sources.)
  
- 🔁 **Repeatable Processes** → Practiced triage workflows to ensure consistency and accuracy in incident handling.

*These exercises simulate real SOC workflows, emphasizing alert prioritization, investigation, and reporting skills.*
